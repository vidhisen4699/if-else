"Instructions that a Python interpreter can execute are called statements. 

also we can understand and called types of statements................................................ 
For example, a = 1 is an assignment statement. if statement, for statement, while statement, etc." 

1). => if statement:
If statements are control flow statements which helps us to run a particular code only 
when a certain condition is satisfied.

For example, you want to print a message on the screen only when a condition is true
              then you can use if statement to accomplish this in programming.

2). => for Statement: for loops are traditionally used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat 
                      a fixed number of times.

3). =>  while statement: The while Loop With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as 
                         a condition is true.

4). =>  The break Statement: With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:

5). => The continue Statement: With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue
                               with the next:


 2). if-elif-else ladder => Here, a user can decide among multiple options. The if statements are executed from the 
                            top down.
