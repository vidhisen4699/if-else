# leap year: What is a leap year? To be a leap year, 
#            the year number must be divisible by four â€“ except for end-of-century years,
#            which must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year,
#            although 1900 was not. 2020, 2024 and 2028 are all leap years.
